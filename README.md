This project applies statistical analysis and machine learning techniques to financial data using the Bank Marketing Dataset. It includes:
* Descriptive and diagnostic analysis to explore data distributions, trends, and outliers.
* Hypothesis testing to validate insights about customer behavior.
* Predictive modeling (classification and regression) to estimate customer subscription likelihood and financial indicators.
The project is fully documented in Jupyter Notebooks and highlights practical skills in Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and data visualization.
